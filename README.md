# Use AI to analyze how to setup Business Intelligence with AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

AI as part of BI (Business Intelligence) has become hot subject over the last years. Here’s the thing, everyone starts with BI and evolve into a data-driven organization, move on to BigData and then AI. Why not flip the coin and start with AI to get the all the answers for this journey?

## Background

However how are you going to use AI in your business and the integration of AI into the business is a very complex area. AI is not just a bag of algorithms it is unlimited, meaning it is only your imagination that can put a limit to its use. To make it even more complicated, one company is not like any other company and its BI will never be the same on two companies. So instead of struggling with how to:
* Implement initial BI
* Become a data-driven organization
* Make use of Big Data
* Implement AI from scratch

Why not let AI do all the work from the start?

## Data and AI techniques

Start off with a Big bang and connect all data in the organization so that it can be accessed from your AI hub. Then apply well-known techniques to assemble the data into continous training data and test data combined with minimalistic supervised learning. Let the AI find the patterns for you and start with an AI driven strategy with cross-validations to find the highest profitability without having the CEO and the CFO saying what is most important.

## How is it used?

Here the thing. We start with nothing and there are no users. The first user will be the AI and it will grow from there into the organization as things progress with the AI’s unique evolution from the data process on that particular company. More and more people will get involved with time and all the non-existing BI techniques will grow in parallel instead for a long and time-consuming timeline as a sequence. The latter is very tiresome for all humans when it clashes with their daily work in the organization.

## Challanges

The challenge is the complexity of AI itself. It will require a very good understanding of the latest areas of AI and how to adopt them into understanding what to produce and interpret from all the data. So how should one think? There is a saying “all roads lead to Rome” and by this it should not matter that you start the process from the end and move forward by creating things that should have been done in the past.

## Challanges


## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
